        ## Arithmetic Sequences
        An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence of numbers where the difference between 
        consecutive terms is constant. This difference is called the **common difference**.
        
        **General Formula:** a‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ + (n-1)d
        **Sum Formula:** S = n/2 √ó (a‚ÇÅ + a‚Çô)
        
        **Examples:**
        - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... (first term = 2, common difference = 2)
        - 10, 7, 4, 1, -2... (first term = 10, common difference = -3)
        
        ## Geometric Sequences
        A **geometric sequence** is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first 
        is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed number called the **common ratio**.
        
        **General Formula:** a‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ √ó r^(n-1)
        **Sum Formula:** S = a‚ÇÅ(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) for r ‚â† 1
        
        **Examples:**
        - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... (first term = 2, common ratio = 2)
        - 100, 50, 25, 12.5... (first term = 100, common ratio = 0.5)
        - 3, 3, 3, 3, 3... (first term = 3, common ratio = 1)
        """)
