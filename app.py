        An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence of numbers where the difference between 
        consecutive terms is constant. This difference is called the **common difference**.
        
        **General Formula:** a‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ + (n-1)d
        
        Where:
        - a‚Çô is the nth term
        - a‚ÇÅ is the first term
        - d is the common difference
        - n is the position of the term
        
        **Sum Formula:** S = n/2 √ó (a‚ÇÅ + a‚Çô)
        
        **Examples:**
        - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... (first term = 2, common difference = 2)
        - 10, 7, 4, 1, -2... (first term = 10, common difference = -3)
